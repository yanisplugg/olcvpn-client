# olcRTC - overview

`olcRTC` (OpenLibreCommunity RTC) is an encrypted TCP-over-WebRTC tunnel. It disguises traffic as ordinary participation in a WebRTC/SFU service: Jitsi Meet, Yandex Telemost or WbStream.

Project: [github.com/openlibrecommunity/olcrtc](https://github.com/openlibrecommunity/olcrtc)  
License: WTFPL  
Status: **Beta**

## Why it is needed

In scenarios where direct access to an arbitrary VPS / IP is blocked, traffic has to be carried through services that are already reachable for the user. To an outside observer the connection looks like an ordinary WebRTC call to an allowed service IP, and the payload inside is additionally encrypted with the shared `crypto.key`.

> **Important:** always check that the video call service you need is on the allow lists. If it is not there, use another one. A list of all allow-listed services will be published soon.

Basic scheme:

```text
app
  -> SOCKS5 127.0.0.1:8808
   -> olcrtc cnc
    -> WebRTC/SFU service
     -> olcrtc srv
       -> internet
```

## How it works

Client mode `cnc` starts a local SOCKS5. A browser, curl, sing-box, olcbox or another app connects to it as to an ordinary proxy.

Server mode `srv` connects to the same room/session, accepts the encrypted smux stream and opens TCP connections to the target addresses on its own behalf.

Inside the tunnel:

```text
SOCKS CONNECT
  -> smux stream
   -> XChaCha20-Poly1305
    -> transport
     -> engine
      -> WebRTC/SFU
```

## Modes

| Mode | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `srv` | server side, accepts tunnel streams and does TCP dial to targets |
| `cnc` | client side, listens on a local SOCKS5 |
| `gen` | creates Room IDs for providers that can create rooms |

The CLI takes a single YAML file:

```bash
olcrtc server.yaml
olcrtc client.yaml
```

## Auth Providers

`auth.provider` selects the service and the way credentials are obtained.

| Provider | Engine | Comment |
|---|---|---|
| `jitsi` | `jitsi` | Jitsi room URL, instances in docs/examples/jitsi.instances.yaml, no separate registration |
| `telemost` | `goolom` | credentials via Yandex Telemost API, separate registration |
| `wbstream` | `livekit` | credentials via WbBStream API, separate registration |
| `none` | set in `engine.name` | direct engine mode with `engine.url` and `engine.token`, separate registration |

The term `carrier` still appears in the internal API and logs as a historical name for the chosen auth/provider path. In YAML the current field is `auth.provider`.

## Engines

`engine` is the low-level protocol of a concrete SFU/signaling:

| Engine | Package | Capabilities |
|---|---|---|
| `livekit` | `internal/engine/livekit` | data packets/video tracks/LiveKit SDK |
| `goolom` | `internal/engine/goolom` | Telemost/Goolom signaling, publisher/subscriber PeerConnection |
| `jitsi` | `internal/engine/jitsi` | Jitsi MUC/Jingle/colibri-ws, datachannel/best-effort video |

`internal/engine/builtin` binds `auth.provider` to the proper engine. There is no separate `internal/carrier` package in the current project.

## Transports

`net.transport` defines how tunnel bytes are placed into a WebRTC primitive.

| Transport | How it carries data | Main scenario |
|---|---|---|
| `datachannel` | native byte/data path of the engine | simplest and fastest path, stable with Jitsi |
| `vp8channel` | KCP over VP8-like video frames | main video path for WB Stream and Telemost |
| `seichannel` | payload in H264 SEI NAL units, ACK/retry | fallback for WB Stream / Jitsi |
| `videochannel` | QR/tile frames via ffmpeg, ACK/retry | experimental visual transport |

Recommended start: `jitsi + datachannel`. Alternative: `wbstream + vp8channel`.

## Encryption and handshake

`internal/crypto` uses XChaCha20-Poly1305. The shared key is set as 64 hex characters:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

`smux` runs on top of the encrypted `muxconn`. The first smux stream is occupied by the handshake and the control protocol:

```text
CLIENT_HELLO -> SERVER_WELCOME
CONTROL_PING <-> CONTROL_PONG
```

If the control pong does not arrive several times in a row, the runtime rebuilds the smux session or hands control to the failover supervisor.

## YAML

Minimal server:

```yaml
mode: srv
auth:
  provider: jitsi
room:
  # Use the Jitsi server that works in your network:
  # Instances: see docs/examples/jitsi.instances.yaml - https://HOST/ROOM
  id: "https://meet.example.org/REPLACE_ME_WITH_ROOM_ID"
crypto:
  key: "REPLACE_ME_WITH_64_HEX_CHARS"
net:
  transport: datachannel
  dns: "8.8.8.8:53"
data: data
```

Minimal client:

```yaml
mode: cnc
auth:
  provider: jitsi
room:
  # Use the Jitsi server that works in your network:
  # Instances: see docs/examples/jitsi.instances.yaml - https://HOST/ROOM
  id: "https://meet.example.org/REPLACE_ME_WITH_ROOM_ID"
crypto:
  key: "REPLACE_ME_WITH_64_HEX_CHARS"
net:
  transport: datachannel
  dns: "8.8.8.8:53"
socks:
  host: "127.0.0.1"
  port: 8808
data: data
```

## Failover

`profiles[]` lets you run several configurations in order. For example, first `wbstream + vp8channel`, then `jitsi + datachannel`. Top-level fields act as defaults, a profile overrides only the parts it needs.

Active smux streams do not migrate when the profile changes. New connections can come up on the next profile.

## Build

```bash
go install github.com/magefile/mage@latest

mage build
mage cross
mage test
mage lint
mage mobile
```

Go version: `1.26+`. `videochannel` requires `ffmpeg`; `codec: tile` requires a resolution of `1080x1080`.

## Public API

`pkg/olcrtc` returns a `net.Conn`-like object on top of auth/engine:

```go
sess, err := olcrtc.New(ctx, olcrtc.Config{
    Auth:   "jitsi",
    // Instances: see docs/examples/jitsi.instances.yaml
    RoomID: "https://meet.example.org/myroom",
})
if err != nil {
    return err
}
conn, err := sess.Dial(ctx)
```

`pkg/olcrtc/tunnel` embeds the server side and exposes hooks:

```go
srv := tunnel.New(tunnel.Config{
    Transport: "datachannel",
    Carrier:   "jitsi",
    // Instances: see docs/examples/jitsi.instances.yaml
    RoomURL:   "https://meet.example.org/myroom",
    KeyHex:    "<64-char hex>",
    DNSServer: "8.8.8.8:53",
})
err := srv.Run(ctx)
```

In this API the `Carrier` field is kept for compatibility with existing integrations; semantically it is the `auth.provider` name.

## Mobile / Android

`mobile/mobile.go` provides a gomobile API:

- `SetProtector` for Android VPN `protect(fd)`;
- `SetTransport`, `SetDNS`, `SetVP8Options`, `SetLivenessOptions`;
- `Start`, `StartWithTransport`, `Stop`;
- `Check`/ping helpers to check reachability.

By default the mobile client uses `vp8channel`; `datachannel` is also supported.

## Tests

```bash
go test -count=1 ./...
mage test
mage e2e
```

Real-provider E2E is enabled via variables:

```bash
E2E_CARRIERS=wbstream E2E_TRANSPORTS= vp8channel mage e2e
```

## Common problems

| Symptom | What to check |
|---|---|
| `key required` or `invalid key` | the same 64-character hex key on both sides |
| SOCKS5 not listening | `mode: cnc`, `socks.host`, `socks.port`, client logs |
| Jitsi does not connect without a second participant | server and client must be in the same room |
| WB Stream + datachannel does not work | guest flow has no `canPublishData`; use `vp8channel`, `seichannel` or `videochannel` |
| `seichannel ack timeout` | the provider throttles/does not route the video path; change transport/provider |
| `ffmpeg` not found | install ffmpeg or set `ffmpeg: /path/to/ffmpeg` |
